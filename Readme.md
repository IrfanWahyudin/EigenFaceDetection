#Face Detection based on Principal Component Analysis (PCA)
Here you can find my code implementation for facial detection based on this paper https://www.cs.ucsb.edu/~mturk/Papers/jcn.pdf and its appendix http://www.vision.jhu.edu/teaching/vision08/Handouts/case_study_pca1.pdf

##Requirements##
You need to install these library:
Numpy
OpenCV
Python 3.6>=

##The Dataset##
You can set your own dataset, just placed in the dataset folder, and uncomment line 95 to extract the face image automatically. Or, if you already have the face samples that dont required to be extracted, then you just need to place those image into cropped folder
